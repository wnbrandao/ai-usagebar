# AI Usage Bar — Windows tray popover

## Corner widget (experimental)

Right-click the AI Usage icon in the notification area and choose **Open Corner
Widget**. The tray executable includes the widget; Python and a separate
download are not needed. Windows PowerShell starts its WPF window in the
background. The compact view is a circular meter for one provider. Hover to
expand the dashboard, drag it to move it, and right-click the widget to choose
the provider shown in the circle, refresh, or quit. The widget follows the
providers enabled in **Settings → Providers**, their order, and the popover's
light or dark theme. The expanded view shows tabs for those providers and the
selected provider's details, using the Windows Native palette. Its position
and selected provider are saved in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ai-usagebar\corner-widget.json`.

The widget reads `ai-usagebar usage --json` every five minutes, using the
`ai-usagebar.exe` installed beside the tray executable. It runs independently
from the tray popover.

A NotifyIcon + WebView2 popover for [`ai-usagebar`](../README.md). Left-click
the tray icon for a dashboard that follows the OpenUsage (SwiftUI edition)
design: a compact 300 px panel that sizes itself to its content, provider sections
with capsule meters, reset countdowns and spend rows. It is the Windows
counterpart to the
[KDE plasmoid](../kde-plasmoid/README.md): same `usage --json` report, same
severity colors, no console window.

The host is `ai-usagebar-tray.exe` (Rust, in-process fetch). The UI is a
Vite + React + shadcn app in `windows/popover/` (Iconify icons via
`unplugin-icons`). The view-model in `src/model.js` has a Node contract
test that does not need `npm install`.

## Install

From [Scoop](https://scoop.sh), via the official bucket:

```powershell
scoop bucket add akitaonrails https://github.com/akitaonrails/scoop-bucket
scoop install ai-usagebar
```

Or grab `ai-usagebar-windows-x86_64.zip` from the latest
[GitHub release](https://github.com/akitaonrails/ai-usagebar/releases) and
unzip it anywhere. Update ownership differs between the two paths: a Scoop
install is updated by Scoop, and **Install Update** runs `scoop update` for
you (see **Settings → Updates** below), while the tray's built-in updater
replaces the files of a standalone ZIP install.

## Requirements

- Windows 10 (recent) or Windows 11, with the **WebView2 Evergreen** runtime
  (preinstalled on Windows 11).
- A Rust toolchain (`rustc` 1.90+).
- **Node.js 20+** on PATH — `cargo build --bin ai-usagebar-tray` runs
  `npm ci` / `npm run build` in `windows/popover/` (Vite emits
  `dist/popover.js` + `dist/popover.css`; `build.rs` stages them into
  `OUT_DIR`, which the host `include_str!`s — without Node it stages a
  placeholder page instead, so `cargo build` still links).
- At least one provider enabled in `%APPDATA%\ai-usagebar\config\config.toml`.

## Build & run

```powershell
cargo build --release --bin ai-usagebar-tray
.\target\release\ai-usagebar-tray.exe
```

The process has no console. If a second instance is started, it exits
immediately. Pin the icon in the Windows 11 notification overflow so it stays
visible.

## Pace

A bounded row with a known window projects the current burn rate to the end
of the window (ported from OpenUsage's Pace) and shows it two ways. A thin
**tick** on the meter marks the even-pace line: where the fill would sit if
usage burned evenly across the window (it mirrors with the Used/Left
toggle). A **note** on the row's first line, right of the label, reads
🔥 "Limit in 1h 53m" (or "Limit today at 11:49 PM" in exact mode) when the
quota runs out before the reset, "~3% spare" when the projection lands in the
last 10 %, and "~40% left at reset" when there is room. Red and orange rows
always show both; blue rows show them only with **Settings → Always Show
Pacing**. Rows with no window, nothing spent yet, or less than 1 % of the
window elapsed show neither. The meter's colour is still the provider's
severity, not the pace verdict.

## Time format

Exact reset times ("Resets today at 6:38 PM") follow the Windows locale by
default. **Settings → Time Format** pins them to 12-hour or 24-hour clocks
regardless of the system setting.

## Updates

The tray checks GitHub Releases of the repository named in `Cargo.toml`'s
`repository` field (`CARGO_PKG_REPOSITORY` at build time) for a newer build, so
a fork that builds its own tray updates from its own releases. **Settings → Updates**
picks the mode: **Automatic** downloads and installs a release as soon as it
is found, **Notify** only shows a banner at the top of the dashboard with an
"Install Update" button (✕ snoozes it; a blue dot next to the version in the
footer remembers it is waiting), and **Off** stops the hourly background
check. **Check Now** runs a check on demand in every mode and the line under
it says when the last one ran. Once a release is known the same button reads
**Update** and installs it. The mode is the `updates` key of the `[tray]`
section in `config.toml`, next to the shortcut and the poll interval.

On a Scoop install, **Install Update** runs `scoop update ai-usagebar` for you;
Automatic hands off the same way. The tray quits while Scoop replaces it,
usually 10–60 seconds, and Scoop relaunches it through `current`. Scoop's
transcript is `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ai-usagebar\updates\scoop.log`. If Scoop does not
deliver the requested version, the tray reports that log path, and Automatic
does not retry it in the background. A global Scoop install without the
`scoop.ps1` shim keeps the release-page fallback.

For a standalone ZIP install, the download is verified against the release's
`.sha256` sidecar, which proves the file arrived intact — integrity, not
authenticity: anyone who can publish a release can publish a matching sidecar. Installing swaps the
running executable for the new one and leaves the previous build as
`ai-usagebar-tray.exe.old`, which the next start removes. Debug builds
(`cargo build` without `--release`) check but refuse to install. The release
assets it looks for (`ai-usagebar-<bin>-windows-x86_64.exe` + `.sha256`) are
produced by the Windows job in `.github/workflows/release.yml`, so the first
release cut after this change is the first one the tray can install.

## When the popover closes

The popover is transient: it hides when you click outside it, click the tray
icon, press the global shortcut again, or press Escape on the dashboard. It
does **not** hide when focus merely moves inside its own process, nor when the
taskbar activates itself with no mouse button down (Windows does that
occasionally on a tray refresh). Vendors that shell out for their data (the
Grok Build ACP, `gh auth token` for Copilot) run their child without a console
window; before that fix each refresh flashed a console that took the
foreground and closed the popover.

To see why it closed, start the tray with `AIUB_TRAY_TRACE=1`: every blur,
report and hide is appended to `%TEMP%i-usagebar-tray-trace.log` with the
window that held the foreground.

## Errors and warnings

A provider whose refresh failed but still has a cached snapshot keeps its
numbers and shows an orange ⚠ in its header plus a one-line note at the
bottom of the card; hovering either shows the raw diagnosis. Antigravity
only reports "isn't running" when there is no local server *and* no saved
Google session to fall back on: with the app closed but signed in, the card
shows the quota from Google's API with a "Source · Google API"
row. A
provider with nothing to show gets a red ⚠ and a card with the verdict, a
hint, and — when the fix is something the tray can do — a button (Open TUI
for a missing key, Refresh for a network or server error). Sign-in problems
name the terminal command instead, and a rate-limited vendor says when it
will retry.

## First launch and provider detection

Before its first report, the tray runs the same local credential detection
OpenUsage does on a fresh install: for every vendor it has not seen before it
checks — on this machine only, never over the network — whether a credential
already exists, and writes `enabled = true` into `config.toml` for the ones
that do. It never turns a vendor off, and it never re-checks a vendor it has
already seen (`%LOCALAPPDATA%ai-usagebardetect.json` remembers them), so
your own `enabled` choices always win. **Options → Detect Providers** re-runs
the check for every vendor on demand, for example after signing in to a new
tool. The same detection is available everywhere as `ai-usagebar detect`
(`--all` to re-check, `--json` for scripts).

After an HTTP 429 the shared cache backs off for five minutes: the card keeps
its last good numbers, or reads "Retrying automatically in 4m" when there are
none, and neither the poll nor a manual Refresh hits that vendor meanwhile.

What each probe looks at: Claude `~/.claude/.credentials.json`; Codex
`~/.codex/auth.json`; Cursor `state.vscdb` or `cursor-agent` `auth.json`;
Kiro `data.sqlite3`; Kimi `~/.kimi-code/credentials`; SuperGrok
`~/.grok/auth.json`; Command Code `~/.commandcode/auth.json`; GitHub Copilot
`GITHUB_COPILOT_TOKEN` or the `gh` CLI `hosts.yml`; Antigravity a running
local product; Nous Research the saved OAuth credential; and every API-key
vendor (Z.AI, OpenRouter, DeepSeek, Grok, Kilo, Novita, Moonshot, MiniMax,
OpenCode Go, Anthropic API) its env var or the `api_key` in `config.toml`.

The first report with data then seeds the popover layout the way OpenUsage
does: providers whose only problem is a missing API key start hidden, and a
welcome card at the top of the dashboard points to **Options → Customize**,
where any provider can be turned back on. That seeding runs once per WebView
profile; afterwards the Customize switches are the only thing that hides a
provider. Hiding is popover-local — to stop fetching a vendor everywhere (TUI,
widget, tray) set `enabled = false` for it in `config.toml` or use the TUI
Settings.

Open TUI launches `ai-usagebar-tui` in Windows Terminal (`wt.exe -e …`) when
present, otherwise `conhost.exe`. Provider keys stay in the TUI (`s`).
Provider order, hidden providers, Always Visible / On Demand rows, theme,
“show usage as” and reset-time format are remembered in the popover.
That memory is the popover's WebView2 profile, kept in
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\ai-usagebar\popover\`, so it survives updates and moves of
the install directory.
Provider marks live in `windows/popover/src/icons/providers/` (OpenUsage, MIT;
simple-icons, CC0) and load through an `unplugin-icons` custom collection;
a provider without a mark shows its initials — including `[[custom]]`
providers from `config.toml` (see the root README, "Custom providers").

The tray re-reads every provider every 5 minutes by default (**Settings →
Refresh Every**: 1, 5 or 10; `[tray] refresh_minutes`). The cache TTL stays
60 s, so the footer's Refresh is always allowed to fetch. A stale or failed vendor is
shown on its card. The global shortcut, the poll interval and the update mode
are the keys of the `[tray]` section in `config.toml`; the popover's Settings
screen writes them. The NotifyIcon is a bar-chart-in-circle mark, three bars inside a ring
(source in `windows/tray-icon.svg`), shipped as anti-aliased rasters
at 16/20/24/32/40/48 px so the shell gets the exact size for the current DPI.
It has no hover tip; the popover is the readout.

![Windows tray icon in the notification area — a bar-chart-in-circle mark beside the overflow chevron](../screenshots/windows-tray-icon.png)

## Tray icon rasters

`src/tray/icon.rs` embeds `windows/tray-icon-{16,20,24,32,40,48}.rgba`
(raw RGBA, black ink, alpha carries the anti-aliasing) and hands the shell the
size `SM_CXSMICON` asks for, so Windows never resamples the glyph. To change
the icon:

1. Overwrite `windows/tray-icon.svg` (24-unit grid, `currentColor` strokes or
   fills, like an Iconify export).
2. Run `node windows/icon/rasterize.js` and open the URL it prints in any
   Chromium or Firefox. `windows/icon/render.html` renders the SVG on a canvas
   at every size, crops one unit off each edge so the mark fills the icon,
   scales strokes per size (`strokeScale` in the page: 1× up to 24 px, 0.9×
   above, tuned for a 2-unit stroke; raise it for a thinner source SVG),
   shows a 3× preview on light and dark, and posts the PNGs back.
3. The script decodes the PNGs itself (no npm packages), forces RGB to black,
   writes the `.rgba` files plus `windows/tray-icon.png` (32 px preview) and
   exits.
4. `cargo test --lib tray::icon` checks every raster is square, black,
   anti-aliased and transparent at the corners; then rebuild the tray.

PNG bytes never go through a terminal or a chat window on purpose: hand-copied
base64 corrupted the rasters twice before this tool existed.

If the popover does not open on Windows 10, install the
[WebView2 Evergreen Runtime](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/webview2).
The tray icon tooltip names that runtime when WebView2 is missing; the
right-click menu still works.

## Tests

```powershell
node windows/popover/popover.test.mjs
cargo test --lib tray
```

Linux CI runs the Node test via `make desktop-test`. The Windows CI job
also compiles the host with `cargo clippy --all-targets` and
`cargo test --all-targets`.
